# Platooning Traffic Application Simulation

This repository contains the simulation code for a Bachelor's thesis project focused on vehicular traffic applications, specifically platooning, using ns-3 and the MilliCar module. The project explores the implementation and evaluation of platooning in vehicular communication networks under different scenarios, leveraging mmWave communication for V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) interactions.

## Overview

The simulation investigates the performance of platooning applications based on 3GPP standards for V2X communications. It utilizes the ns-3 network simulator and the MilliCar module to model mmWave communication between vehicles. The application assesses various metrics such as latency, throughput, and packet loss rate under different conditions, including vehicle density and communication channel states.
